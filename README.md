# Web design workflow

A Pug and Sass based workflow for website development. Gulp used for BrowserSync and for compiling Pug and Sass
Website is made from different Pug partials and compiled in a master index.Pug file.
Sass works the same, different sub files to compile the whole work.
Files should get individual names for to easy additions and removals.
This is to be a modular system for website development
